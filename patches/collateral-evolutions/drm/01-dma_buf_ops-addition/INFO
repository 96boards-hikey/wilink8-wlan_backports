Assign vmap, vunmap and mmap fields in dma_buf_ops structs only
if kernel version >= 3.5.0 as they are added in 3.5. The begin_cpu_access
was added as of the original dma-buf code via 3.4.

mcgrof@frijol ~/linux-next (git::master)$ git describe --contains fc13020e086bfedf2afb95c91c026d5af1f80107
v3.4-rc1~57^2~3

Note that the dma-buf itself was added with 3.4. It is not available
on kernels < 3.4.
