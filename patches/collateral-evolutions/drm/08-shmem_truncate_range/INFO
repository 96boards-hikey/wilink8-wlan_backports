Backport e2377fe0b -- this could likely be implemented
on compat.git but I'd much prefer a better review of that.
For now this stays as a patch.

    drm/i915: use shmem_truncate_range
    
    The interface to ->truncate_range is changing very slightly: once "tmpfs:
    take control of its truncate_range" has been applied, this can be applied.
     For now there is only a slight inefficiency while this remains unapplied,
    but it will soon become essential for managing shmem's use of swap.
    
    Change i915_gem_object_truncate() to use shmem_truncate_range() directly:
    which should also spare i915 later change if we switch from
    inode_operations->truncate_range to file_operations->fallocate.
