We cannot backport remove_proc_subtree() modularly so the
only thing we can do is revert its usage. This patch reverts
all of its usage and the commits that added them are listed
below.

Another thing we could do is look at each driver's usage of
proc and see if its reasonable to instead covert it to use
debugfs. This needs to be dealt with on a case by case basis.

Subject: [PATCH] drm: proc: Use remove_proc_subtree()

Use remove_proc_subtree() rather than remove_proc_entry() to remove a
minor-specific drm proc directory and all its children.

Things could theoretically be improved by storing the drm_minor pointer in the
minor-specific dir proc_dir_entry struct data and then scrapping the list of
proc files - but that's shared with the debugfs interface where you can't do
that, so I don't see an easy way of doing it.
