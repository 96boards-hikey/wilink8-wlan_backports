This patch backports the struct net_device_ops changes added on 2.6.29.

If we add the compat.git netdev_attach_ops() implementation
for newer kernels upstream it means we do not have to use this
patch at all for older kernels.

    netdev: network device operations infrastructure
    
    This patch changes the network device internal API to move adminstrative
    operations out of the network device structure and into a separate structure.
    
    This patch involves some hackery to maintain compatablity between the
    new and old model, so all 300+ drivers don't have to be changed at once.
    For drivers that aren't converted yet, the netdevice_ops virt function list
    still resides in the net_device structure. For old protocols, the new
    net_device_ops are copied out to the old net_device pointers.
    
    After the transistion is completed the nag message can be changed to
    an WARN_ON, and the compatiablity code can be made configurable.
    
    Some function pointers aren't moved:
    * destructor can't be in net_device_ops because
      it may need to be referenced after the module is unloaded.
    * neighbor setup is manipulated in a couple of places that need special
      consideration
    * hard_start_xmit is in the fast path for transmit.
