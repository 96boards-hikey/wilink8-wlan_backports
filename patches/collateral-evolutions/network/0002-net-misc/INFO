These are things that removed in later kernels but no good explanatin
was provided as to their removal. We should review if this is needed
and if not remove these hunks.

Pretty sure we can remove the netdev_tx_t hunk change on
net/bluetooth/bnep/netdev.c, removing that hunk just needs to be
compile tested against older kernels.
