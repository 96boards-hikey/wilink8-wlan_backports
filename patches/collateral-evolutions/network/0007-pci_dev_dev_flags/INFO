The struct pci_dev dev_flags member was added as of
v2.6.24 via ba698ad4. This collateral evolution can be
enhanced and backported atomically through these series
of patches. The end goal is to optimize this in SmPL form.

    PCI: Add quirk for devices which disable MSI when INTX_DISABLE is set.
    
    A reasonably common problem with some devices is that they will
    disable MSI generation when the INTX_DISABLE bit is set in the
    PCI_COMMAND register.
    
    Quirk this explicitly, guarding the pci_intx() calls in msi.c with
    this quirk indication.
    
    The first entries for this quirk are for 5714 and 5780 Tigon3 chips,
    and thus we can remove the workaround code from the tg3.c driver.
