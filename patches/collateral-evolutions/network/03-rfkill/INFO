rfkill was re-implemented on 2.6.31. We port it to
older kernels with a simple hack, just rename the
module as a new one rfkill_backport, and every
exported symbol gets redefined with a _backport
postfix through compat-2.6.31.h. The changes below
are the ones we could not do through compat-2.6.31.h

Do older kernels have /dev/rfkill ? I not then we can
just keep /dev/rfkill and not /dev/rfkill_backport.

Note that 2.6.31 added netdevice notifier upon interface
dev_open() which on cfg80211 will check if checks to see
if rfkill is enabled (or if the mode of operation is not
supported) on the  cfg80211_netdev_notifier_call() and if
so deny bringing the interface up. This was added via
commit:

3b8bcfd5d31ea0fec58681d035544ace707d2536

Since older kernels will not have the notifier call
on dev_open() if we *really want* to port this we could have
mac80211's subif_open() call :

	ret = call_netdevice_notifiers(NETDEV_PRE_UP, dev);
	ret = notifier_to_errno(ret);
	if (ret)
		return ret;

This would do the policing from within mac80211.
