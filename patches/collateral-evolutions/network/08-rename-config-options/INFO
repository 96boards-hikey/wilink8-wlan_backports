This file renames CONFIG_ options that may be defined in older
kernels but that we know we can *safely* rename to other config
option names to ensure we disable building these options at
through this framework. An example here is ath9k's rate control
aglorithm is always selected by default via CONFIG_ATH9K_RATE_CONTROL.
By renaming this to CONFIG_COMPAT_ATH9K_RATE_CONTROL we have
the flexibility to disable it for a replacement driver.

In kernel 2.6.26 and older CONFIG_IWL4965 was build as an extra
module, but now it is directly included in the iwlagn.

CONFIG_IWL4965 has to be set to y, to build correctly.

zd1211rw does not build with kernel < 2.6.28, but it is often activated 
in the kernel config of older kernels. We rename the option to 
deactivate it on older kernels.
CONFIG_BT_L2CAP and CONFIG_BT_SCO are boolean now, but often set to m 
in the kernel config.

CONFIG_BT_HIDP does not build with older kernel versions.
