The 2.6.29 kernel has new struct dev_pm_ops [1] which are used
on the pci device to distinguish power management hooks for suspend
to RAM and hibernation. Older kernels don't have these so we need
to resort back to the good ol' suspend/resume. Fortunately the calls
are not so different so it should be possible to resuse the same
calls on compat code with only slight modifications.
