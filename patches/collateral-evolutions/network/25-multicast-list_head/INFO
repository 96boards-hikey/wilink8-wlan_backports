Backport commit 22bedad3ce112d5ca1eaf043d4990fa2ed698c87:
  net: convert multicast list to list_head

  Converts the list and the core manipulating with it to be the same as uc_list.

  +uses two functions for adding/removing mc address (normal and "global"
   variant) instead of a function parameter.
  +removes dev_mcast.c completely.
  +exposes netdev_hw_addr_list_* macros along with __hw_addr_* functions for
   manipulation with lists on a sandbox (used in bonding and 80211 drivers)

This also backport commit 2f787b0b76bf5de2eaa3ca3a29d89123ae03c856
