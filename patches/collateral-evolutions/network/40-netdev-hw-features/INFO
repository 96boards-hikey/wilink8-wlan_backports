This reverts the commits that deal with hw_features and
set_features, fix_features for kernels < 2.6.39.

Below is one example commit being reverted, but we also do
this for ath6kl and any driver that uses this in this file.

    net: atl*: convert to hw_features
    
    Things left as they were:
     - atl1: is RX checksum really enabled?
     - atl2: copy-paste from atl1, with-errors-on-modify I presume
     - atl1c: there's a bug: MTU can't be changed if device is not up
