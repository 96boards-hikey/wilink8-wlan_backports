The UAPI changes split up the kernel and userspace API
headers into separate directories. We provide backport
support for the new rfkill module to kernels older than
2.6.31. To allow us to dynamically provide only backport
support for those kernels we have a trick within compat
to provide its own include/linux/rfkill.h header which
then will include either your own kernel's rkfill.h or
include the one we are taking from linux-next. The one
we take from linux-next is renamed to rfkill_backport.h.
In order to allow the call to include your own kernel's
rfkill.h the compat rfkill.h uses include_next. The UAPI
changes would mean though that instead of getting your
own kernel's rfkill.h you'd end up getting the UAPI
header file. Fix this by ensuring that for new kernels
we linux_next into the user's kernels rfkill.h and if
the kernel is old we still to the rfkill_backport.h
naming scheme.
