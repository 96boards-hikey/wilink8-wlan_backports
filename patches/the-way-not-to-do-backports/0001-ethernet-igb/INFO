This series needs work, each atomic patch backport requirements needs to be
split out atomically into either an existing matching series under

patches/collateral-evolutions/network/
patches/collateral-evolutions/generic/

Or a new series for either of them needs to be created, each change must
document the original patch that introduced the change that incurred the
backport being peformed, and the respective kernel in which it was introduced
which can be obtained by 'git describe --contains sha1sum'.
